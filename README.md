# Adventure of Seth (In Development)

A very simple text-based dungeon crawling game written in C uses `ncurses` library.

## 🛠️ Development

Make sure you already installed `ncurses` development library, and I develop it using `mingw` so it may or may not compile using default makefile I provided. You can configure the game title or keymapping in `./config.h.in`.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/UnknownRori/adventure-of-seth

# Enter cloned directory
cd adventure-of-seth

# Build the game
make build
```

## 🚀 Usage

It may or may not work on your terminal, mine? it work but barely.

```bash
# Start the game
./temp/adventure
```
